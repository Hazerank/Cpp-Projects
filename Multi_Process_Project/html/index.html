  <h1>What I did</h1>
  <p>
    I use C++ language to implement the given assignment. I filled the process.cpp and watchdog.cpp regarding to fulfill the project. Let me explain them one by one:  
  </p>
  <h2>process.cpp</h2>
  <p>
    Process file will be the template for every process instance. In this file, firstly I assigned the comment line arguments to the corresponding variables as the name of the project and the outputh file path.
    Then I used a signal structure to catch the signals that are sent from executor.cpp via kill() function. This structure is prior than the other lines and when a signal is catched from a process, actually this structure catches it and calls the corresponding function with signals value as parameter.
    Then in the following part, I create a message to inform user that the specific process is created successfully. Than I started to wait and sleep for signals.
    In the signal handler, I handle the signal as indicated in the pdf.
  </p>
  <h2>watchdog.cpp</h2>
  <p>
    Watchdog.cpp is the parrent process that runs all the time and controls all other prcoess processes. Every process instance is created from watchod via fork function and than with the call of exec() function, overrides the code segment in the process.cpp. 
    It firstly takes the console arguments and assing corresponding variables. What I did additionaly is creating a pid_t array to store all created processes' pid values.
    After creating write end of the pipe shared with executor.cpp , I create and if it is already exist, clear the output files.
    In this file I use 2 signal catcher function and 1 helper createAll() function.
    In the main, as a first job, watchdog puts its pid to the array and to the pipe. Than it calls the createAll function.
    createAll() function uses the fork() exec() dual to create process instances. It calls fork() and after than, realize which instance is the parrent and child. In the child, after printing the message, calls exec to create a process.
    In the parrent process, which is watchdogs itself, I store the created childs information in the array.
    At the end of the creation, I traverse the array in order to pass the pid-name values to the pipe.
    In the signal handler functions, signalProcess() is the complicated one. It is connected with the SIGCHLD signal which is sent from a child when it is killed. So this function is handles the re-creation of the death children.
    It determines which child is death from waitpid() function and than creates a new process via fork() to replace death process. It pushes the information of the death children to the pipe offcourse.
    When p1 is killed, it sends SIGTERM signal to the all children processes and than calls createAll() function one more time to re-create all processes. 
  </p>
  <h2>Overall Ideas and Comments</h2>
  <p> In the project we use activelly the concurrency principal to create and run all process processes together. Active use of fork() and exec() and wait() made me familiar with these concepts. 
    We determined the parrent and child from the return value of fork() and we rewrite watchdog using exec().
    The key point of using wait() function was preventing the zombie processes. With this, there were no zombie processes as well as we were able to determine which child is killed and should be re-created.
    I strugled with the lineer output part a little bit but I resulted in a consistent system in my computer. I hope test computer is also as fast as mine :)
